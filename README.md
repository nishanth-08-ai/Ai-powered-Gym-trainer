# StrideSync - AI Enhanced Workout Tracking and Form Validation  

## Overview  
StrideSync is an AI-powered fitness tracking system that integrates **computer vision** and **machine learning** to provide real-time **exercise monitoring**, **form validation**, **BMI calculation**, and **food composition analysis**. By leveraging YOLOv8 for food detection and MediaPipe for pose estimation, StrideSync offers a comprehensive solution for health and fitness tracking.

## Features  
- **Exercise Tracking**: Real-time pose estimation using MediaPipe to analyze workout form and count repetitions.  
- **Form Validation**: Provides feedback on correct exercise posture using joint angle calculations.  
- **BMI Calculator**: Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and suggests personalized workout plans.  
- **Food Composition Analysis**: Detects food items using YOLOv8 and calculates nutritional values.  
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Flask and Tkinter, with a web interface for real-time visualization.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, YOLOv8  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch
